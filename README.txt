Stream. Passive income for everyone.

Minimum Viable Product(MVP) Description
1. User can invest in a desired fraction of a node.
2. User can do the above on a low-fee chain.
3. User can transfer fractional node ownership rights.

Steps to Reach MVP
1. Make a contract:
    a. Which has pools that represent the amount required to create a node.
    b. User can deposit a fraction of that amount and participate to the rewards proportionaly.
    c. The protocol generates income through fees collected for pool participation and reward distribution.
2. When the protocol generates enough income it may create its own pools. These pools' ownership wrights 
can then be made available for sale on low-fee chains.
3. When user invests in a pool, he will receive node ownership tokens (nodebits) that represent his part.
Nodebit is an ERC-20 token and is transferable to any third party user. When the protocol distributes
rewards, it will mint native reward tokens to Nodebit holders.
